Revision history for WWW-Myspace-Data

0.16    2008-01-10
        Added get_comments method.
        Updated mysql.txt to include "comments" and "messages" tables.
        Added get_comments script to 'examples'.
        Fixed bug which would cause get_comments to return the last comment
        cached twice.
        Fixed count of tests in 01-data.t.
        Updated WWW::Myspace requirement to 0.74.
        Added get_age method.
        Added last_login method.
        Removed redundant setting of last_lookup_id after calls to cache_friend.
        Added Class::DBI::AbstractSearch to Makefile.PL

0.15	2007-09-18
		Added minimum requirement for WWW::Myspace.pm of 0.71 since Myspace
		keeps changing the login form.

0.14    2007-07-25
        Removed bug where options were being set twice in _loader.
        get_account will now create the account if it can't find it
        instead of croaking.
        cache_friend no longer displays warning about undefined value
        in numeric eq (==).
        relationships param now set to 0 in Data::->_loader() to fix RT bug 
        #28460

0.13    2007-07-17
        cache_friend now requires friend_id as its sole argument
        cache_friend now caches is_invalid when it is true.  
        Previously it had only cached when is_invalid is false.
        track_friend now prints a warning and returns 0 if:
            a profile is_invalid
            no friend_id can be found on the page
        (since myspace is so unreliable, it was problematic
        to die on a missing friend_id)
        cache_friend now uses $page->decoded_content
        cache_friend now gets friend_url and friend_user_name
        from WWW::Myspace methods rather than by applying its
        own regexes.

0.12    2007-07-03
        Added 2 new cols (is_invalid, is_private) to "friends" table
        Added 2 new methods: is_invalid, is_private

0.11    2007-06-29
        Module split from WWW::Myspace distribution
        Added examples/friend_adder.pl to  with accompanying 
        examples/adder.cfg file
        Updated tests so that Myspace login is not required
